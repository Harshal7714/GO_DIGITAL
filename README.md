# Data Transfer Application with AWS Services

This repository contains code and instructions for creating a Docker image to transfer data from Amazon S3 to either Amazon RDS or AWS Glue Database. The Docker image is then deployed to AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry), and a Lambda function is created using this image to perform data transfer tasks.


## Introduction

This application is designed to facilitate the transfer of data from Amazon S3 to either Amazon RDS or AWS Glue Database using Python. The code utilizes boto3 for S3 operations and pymysql for RDS interactions. If RDS is not available, the data is pushed to Glue Database. The application is packaged into a Docker image and deployed to AWS ECR for use in creating a Lambda function.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- An AWS account with necessary permissions to create and manage ECR repositories, RDS instances, and Lambda functions.
- Docker installed on your local machine for building the Docker image.
- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate credentials.
- Terraform installed on your local machine for managing AWS resources.
- Basic knowledge of Python programming, Docker, and Terraform.

## Code Explanation

The provided Python code (`python-Code.py`) contains functions to read data from S3, push it to RDS, and push it to Glue Database if RDS is not available. The Dockerfile specifies the environment and instructions to build the Docker image containing the Python code.

## Docker Image Creation

To create the Docker image:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and Python code.
3. Build the Docker image using the following command:

docker build -t data-transfer .

4. Verify that the image is created successfully by running:

## Deployment to AWS ECR

To deploy the Docker image to AWS ECR:

1. Log in to your AWS account and navigate to the ECR service in the AWS Management Console.
2. Create a new repository for your Docker image.
3. Follow the instructions to push the Docker image to the ECR repository.

## Creating Lambda Function

To create a Lambda function using the Docker image:

1. Log in to your AWS account and navigate to the Lambda service in the AWS Management Console.
2. Create a new Lambda function and choose "Container image" as the runtime.
3. Select the ECR repository and specify the Docker image tag.
4. Configure the Lambda function settings as needed, including memory, timeout, and permissions.

## Testing Lambda Function

After creating the Lambda function, you can test it using sample data or by triggering it with an S3 event. Monitor the Lambda function's execution and verify that the data transfer operation is successful.
